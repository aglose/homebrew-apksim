# Homebrew cask for the aglose/homebrew-apksim tap: brew tap aglose/apksim, brew trust
# aglose/apksim (Homebrew 7 loads casks only from trusted taps), then brew install apksim
# .github/workflows/release.yml fills in the version and checksum of each published release and pushes the result to
# the tap as Casks/apksim.rb; this copy is the template.
# A cask rather than a formula: the release is prebuilt and self-contained (its own JDK 24 runtime, libraries and
# native code), and Homebrew installs a formula without a bottle only with up-to-date Command Line Tools.

  # `apksim beam install` (opt-in) adds two LaunchAgents: launchd starts the agent when a browser page asks
  # (docs/beam.md). Not removed by `uninstall`: `brew upgrade` runs a cask's uninstall launchctl and delete too, which
  # took them away at every upgrade. Each job removes itself once bin/apksim is gone (BeamLaunchd.guarded); zap removes
  # them at once.

  caveats <<~EOS
    The first launch builds a startup cache in ~/.apksim in the background (1-2 minutes, once per version);
    launches are faster after that. To build it now instead:
      apksim --train
    To let pages of an apksim serve with --allow-beam run their apps on this Mac (each site asks you first):
      apksim beam install
    Your team's own site can be allowed up front, so it does not ask:
      apksim beam install --trust https://dashboard.example.com
